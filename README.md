# Running a QRL node on a Raspberry Pi

Running a [QRL](https://www.theqrl.org/) node strengthens the network, supports the decentralization and further verifies transactions on the network. 

This project is a PoC developped during the [QRL Winter Hackathon 2021](https://www.theqrl.org/blog/qrl-winter-hackathon-2021/).

## Node setup

1) [Download and flash Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/). 
		
	- Tests were done with [`Raspberry Pi OS with desktop`](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/#raspberry-pi-os-32-bit) (with the Rapsberry Pi imager, choose Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit))
	
2) Boot the Raspberry Pi and connect to a network.

3) Open a terminal and download the installation script. Make the script executable.

	    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xFF0/QRL_rpi/main/Install_qrl_node_pi.sh
	    $ chmod +x Install_qrl_node_pi.sh
	
4) Run the script (it takes approximatively 2 hours to setup everything).

	    $ ./Install_qrl_node_pi.sh


5) When youâ€™re done, you can start the QRL node. 

	    $ start_qrl

## Models tested
This command was used to identify the pi model number: `cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep 'Revision' | awk '{print $3}'`.

Raspberry Pi tested are: 

| Revision      | Model         | RAM       | Results   |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------- | --------- |
| a21041        | 2 Model B     | 1 GB      | Works     |
| c03111        | 4 Model B     | 4 GB      | Works     |
| c03112        | 4 Model B     | 4 GB      | Works     |
| a02082        | 3 Model B     | 1 GB      | Works     |
| 9000c1        | Zero W        | 512 MB    | Works     |
